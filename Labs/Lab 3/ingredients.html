            <h1>Ingredients of Homemade Cake</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups of all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup of butter</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>1 cup of milk</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla essence</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>
                Making a homemade sponge cake was never so easy. Begin by mixing sugar and butter together. Whisk well until light and fluffy with a manual whisker or a fork. Once done, add the beaten eggs and blend well. Beat further so that the mixture turns white and creamy.

            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p > 
                Sift together the all-purpose flour and baking soda. It is done to evenly distribute the baking soda in flour. Gradually, add this to the egg mixture. If required, add a little milk and mix till the batter is fluffy and soft. You may not add the entire milk if you feel the consistency of your cake is fine and it pours down like canned condensed milk. Add vanilla essence and blend well. Vanilla essence is important to camouflage the smell of eggs and to make the cake taste delicious.
