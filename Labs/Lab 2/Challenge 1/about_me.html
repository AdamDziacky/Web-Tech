        <h2>My career at Edinburgh Napier Uni (so far)</h2>
    
        <p>I am a second year student at Edinburgh Napier University. My module is called
            <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/beng-hons-cybersecurity-and-forensics-undergraduate-fulltime">Cybersecurity & Forensics</a>
        So far, I enjoy the module very much. Despite studying 2 year almost exclusively online, it's finally getting back to normal. <br>
